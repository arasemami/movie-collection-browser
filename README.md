## Overview
This is an Angular project that uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Cypress for testing. It is designed to be modular, scalable, and easy to set up.

## Features
- Angular framework
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Organized folder structure
- Modern development tools

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/arasemami/movie-collection-browser.git
   cd movie-collection-browser
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Development Server
To start the development server, run:
```sh
ng serve
```
This will serve the application at `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Running Tests

```sh
npm run e2e
```

To run All Cypress tests in Command Line:
```sh
npm run e2e:ci
```

To run Unit tests:
```sh
ng test
```

## Building the Project
To build the project for production:
```sh
npm run build
```
The output will be in the `dist/` directory.


## Code Structure

â”‚   â”‚   â”‚-- constant/               # Constants used across the application  
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚-- interfaces/             # TypeScript interfaces for data models  
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚-- services/               # Shared services used across modules  
â”‚   â”‚-- watchlist/  
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚-- components/             # Components related to the user's watchlist  

cypress

â”‚-- fixtures/ # Mock data for testing
â”‚ â”‚-- movie/ # Fixtures related to movie tests
â”‚ â”‚-- watchlist/ # Fixtures related to watchlist tests
â”‚-- support/ # Custom commands and utility functions
â”‚ â”‚-- step_definitions/ # Step definitions for BDD-style tests

â”‚ â”‚-- watchlist/ # Test recordings for watchlist-related tests

```


### ðŸ”¹ **Key Highlights**  
âœ… **Feature-Based Organization:** Each feature (Movie, Watchlist, Not Found) is self-contained.  
âœ… **Shared Module:** Common components, constants, and services are placed in a `shared` directory to avoid redundancy.  
âœ… **State Management:** Uses a dedicated `state` folder for handling application state (e.g., NgRx, signals, or RxJS).  
âœ… **Facade Pattern:** A `facade` layer abstracts service complexities, improving maintainability.  
âœ… **End-to-End Testing:** Cypress is used for automated testing with structured fixtures, step definitions, and video recordings.  

This structure ensures **scalability, reusability, and easy maintenance** as the project grows. ðŸš€
